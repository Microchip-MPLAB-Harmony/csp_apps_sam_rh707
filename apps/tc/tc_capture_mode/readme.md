# TC capture mode

This example shows how to use the TC module in capture mode to measure duty cycle and frequency of an external input.

## Description

The TC channel is configured in capture mode to measure duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal. The PWM signal is generated using another TC channel which is configured in compare mode. Output of the compare TC channel is connected to input of the capture TC channel.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up SAM RH707 Evaluation Kit

- TC1 generates the PWM waveform on pin PA27
- TC0 is configured in capture mode with the input signal connected to pin PA29
- Use a jumper wire to connect "Pin 16 of J19" to "Pin 17 of J20"
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect the debugger probe to J5 connector
- Connect the J1 (USB-C) port on the board to the computer using a USB-C cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the USB to UART COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Console displays the frequency and duty cycle of the input signal
5. Frequency is constant (2500 Hz) and duty cycle changes by 1%
