# ADC Polling

This example application shows how to sample an analog input in polled mode and send the converted data to console.

## Description

In this example, Analog input voltage in the range of 0 V to 3.3 V (from potentiometer) is fed to the ADC and converted value is displayed on the console. The ADC conversion is triggered by software and result is polled using status API.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_rh707) and then click **Clone** button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/adc/adc_polled_mode/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_rh707_ek.X | SAM RH707 Evaluation Kit() |
|||

### Setting up SAM RH707 Evaluation Kit

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect the debugger probe to J5 connector
- Connect the J1 (USB-C) port on the board to the computer using a USB-C cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the USB to UART COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. Vary ADC input voltage from potentiometer (R109 - POT) and observe ADC count on console
